# Personal Website
<!-- PROJECT LOGO -->
- My name is Sebastian Bastida Marin and I am a computer science student. 

- I created this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills and passion for programming. Here you'll find a variety of projects I've worked on. 

- I am particularly interested in programming & technology and I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in this field. This website serves as a platform for me to demonstrate my abilities, and showcase my different skills to improve on them as a personal learning experience. 

- As I continue on my studies, I hope to work on even more ambitious and innovative projects. On the website, you can find a portfolio of my work and my contact information. 

- Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate or discuss any programming-related topics. Thank you for visiting! <br />
